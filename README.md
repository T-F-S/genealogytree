Pedigree and genealogical tree diagrams are proven tools to visualize genetic
and relational connections between individuals. The naming for mathematical tree
structures with parent nodes and child nodes is traded from historical family
diagrams. However, even the smallest family entity consisting of two parents and
several children is no mathematical tree but a more general graph. The
`genealogytree` packages provides a set of tools to typeset such genealogical
trees or, more precisely, to typeset a set of special graphs for the description
of family-like structures. The package uses an autolayout algorithm which can be
customized to e.g. prioritize certain paths.
